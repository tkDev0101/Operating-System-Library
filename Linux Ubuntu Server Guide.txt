Linux Ubuntu Server Guide

Here are some essential commands to navigate the system:

pwd           # Shows your current location in the system
ls            # Lists the files and folders in the current directory
cd folder     # Moves into a specific folder
cd ..         # Moves up one level in the directory tree
mkdir newdir  # Creates a new folder
rm file       # Deletes a file
rm -r dir     # Deletes a directory and its contents


 - User Commands
whoami         # Shows your current username
id             # Displays your user and group IDs
adduser newuser  # Creates a new user
passwd newuser   # Changes a user's password
deluser newuser  # Deletes a user


 - Understanding File Permissions:
ls -l file   # View file permissions
chmod 755 file  # Change file permissions
chown user file  # Change file ownership



 - Installing and Managing Software (APT Package Manager)

Ubuntu Server uses APT (Advanced Package Tool) to install and manage software. 
It’s very similar to an app store, but everything is done through the command line.

Essential Commands for Package Management:
apt update             # Updates the list of available software
apt upgrade            # Upgrades installed software to the latest versions
apt install package    # Installs a new software package
apt remove package     # Removes a software package
apt search package     # Searches for available software

Want to install a web server? Try this:
 - apt install apache2 -y


 - Networking Basics
A server without networking is like a car without wheels—it won’t go anywhere. Here are some essential network commands:

ip a               # Shows IP addresses
ip route           # Displays network routes
hostname -I        # Shows your server’s IP address
ping google.com    # Tests if you have internet connectivity
netstat -tulnp     # Lists open network ports

These commands help you diagnose and manage network connections on your server.


 - Monitoring System Performance:
top         # Shows active processes
htop        # A better, interactive process viewer (install using `apt install htop`)
free -h     # Shows memory usage
df -h       # Shows disk space usage
uptime      # Shows how long the server has been running


 - Securing Your Server with a Firewall (UFW)
Ubuntu comes with UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to help you manage access to services.

ufw status           # Checks if the firewall is enabled
ufw allow ssh        # Allows SSH access
ufw allow 80/tcp     # Allows HTTP traffic (for web servers)
ufw enable           # Activates the firewall
ufw disable          # Deactivates the firewall


 - Server Updates
apt update && apt upgrade -y  # Updates the system packages
reboot                        # Restarts the server
shutdown -h now               # Shuts down the server


 - Remote Access with SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) lets you control your server from another computer. 
This is especially useful for managing cloud servers.

 - To enable SSH on Ubuntu Server:
apt install openssh-server -y
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl start ssh

 - To connect from another computer:
ssh username@server-ip
Example: ssh user@192.168.1.100
